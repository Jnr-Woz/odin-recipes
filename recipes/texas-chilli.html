    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Texas Chili is a legendary and robust dish that embodies the bold and hearty flavors of Texas cuisine. 
        This chili is known for its deep, smoky flavors and spicy kick. To make Texas Chili, start by browning 
        chunks of beef, such as chuck roast or brisket, in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
        Once the beef is browned, remove it from the pot and set it aside. In the same pot, sauté diced onions, 
        garlic, and bell peppers until they become soft and fragrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Return the beef to the pot and add in a combination of beef broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, 
        and a blend of spices like chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, oregano, and salt. 
        Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for a few 
        hours on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and the beef to become tender. Throughout the 
        cooking process, check the chili and add more liquid if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        For authenticity, traditional Texas Chili does not include beans, but you can certainly add them 
        if desired. Once the chili has thickened and the beef is melt-in-your-mouth tender, it's ready to be 
        served. Ladle the piping hot Texas Chili into bowls and garnish with toppings like shredded cheese, 
        chopped onions, jalapeños, and a dollop of sour cream. This hearty and spicy chili is perfect for 
        chilly evenings or gatherings with friends, and it's sure to satisfy your cravings for bold Texan 
        flavors.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly 
            toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; 
            let stand for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each 
            pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste 
            forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and 
            pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally 
            to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 
            beef.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and 
            translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and 
            fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to avoid lumps. 
            Add stock and remaining 1 1/4 cups water and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to maintain a 
            very low simmer and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 
            2 hours. Stir in brown sugar and vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat and let stand for 20 minutes before serving warm with sour cream and lime wedges.
        </li>
    </ol>
