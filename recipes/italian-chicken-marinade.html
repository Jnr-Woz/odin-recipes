        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            The Italian Chicken Marinade is a simple yet flavorful combination of ingredients that 
            infuses chicken with the delicious essence of Italian cuisine. In a bowl, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, 
            lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper are whisked 
            together to create a well-blended marinade.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chicken is then placed in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag and coated with the marinade. 
            After refrigerating for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours, the chicken absorbs the flavors, 
            resulting in a tantalizing taste. When it's time to cook, the chicken is removed from the marinade 
            and cooked according to your preference, whether it's grilling, baking, or pan-searing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result is tender, juicy chicken infused with the aromatic essence of Italian herbs and spices. 
            It can be served as a delectable main dish or incorporated into various Italian-inspired recipes for a 
            burst of Mediterranean flavors.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-styly salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powdder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish;
                add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in 
                the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining</li>
            <li>
                Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices
                run clear about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
